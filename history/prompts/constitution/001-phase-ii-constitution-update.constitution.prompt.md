## Prompt

/sp.constitution Phase II: Todo Full-Stack Web Application
Basic Level Functionality
Objective: Using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus transform the console app into a modern multi-user web application with persistent storage.
💡Development Approach: Use the Agentic Dev Stack workflow: Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.
Requirements
Implement all 5 Basic Level features as a web application
Create RESTful API endpoints
Build responsive frontend interface
Store data in Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database
Authentication – Implement user signup/signin using Better Auth

Securing the REST API
Better Auth + FastAPI Integration
The Challenge
Better Auth is a JavaScript/TypeScript authentication library that runs on your Next.js frontend. However, your FastAPI backend is a separate Python service that needs to verify which user is making API requests.
The Solution: JWT Tokens
Better Auth can be configured to issue JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens when users log in. These tokens are self-contained credentials that include user information and can be verified by any service that knows the secret key.
How It Works
User logs in on Frontend → Better Auth creates a session and issues a JWT token
Frontend makes API call → Includes the JWT token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header
Backend receives request → Extracts token from header, verifies signature using shared secret
Backend identifies user → Decodes token to get user ID, email, etc. and matches it with the user ID in the URL
Backend filters data → Returns only tasks belonging to that user
What Needs to Change
Component
Changes Required
Better Auth Config
Enable JWT plugin to issue tokens
Frontend API Client
Attach JWT token to every API request header
FastAPI Backend
Add middleware to verify JWT and extract user
API Routes
Filter all queries by the authenticated user's ID

The Shared Secret
Both frontend (Better Auth) and backend (FastAPI) must use the same secret key for JWT signing and verification. This is typically set via environment variable BETTER_AUTH_SECRET in both services.
Security Benefits
Benefit
Description
User Isolation
Each user only sees their own tasks
Stateless Auth
Backend doesn't need to call frontend to verify users
Token Expiry
JWTs expire automatically (e.g., after 7 days)
No Shared DB Session
Frontend and backend can verify auth independently

API Behavior Change
After Auth:
All endpoints require valid JWT token
Requests without token receive 401 Unauthorized
Each user only sees/modifies their own tasks
Task ownership is enforced on every operation

Bottom Line
The REST API endpoints stay the same (GET /api/user_id/tasks, POST /api/user_id/tasks, etc.), but every request now must include a JWT token, and all responses are filtered to only include that user's data.
